            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe Rebellions (after many yeares continuance) were totally repreſſed by that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Princeſſe Queene <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> who having finiſhed that worke was called to another Kingdome, there to enjoy an everlaſting Crowne of Glory. Since which time by the goodneſſe of Almighty God, and the moſt happy, prudent, and peaceable governement of our late Soveraigne King <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memory, and of his moſt Excellent Majeſtie that now is (eſpecially ſince your Lordſhips governement here) that Eclipſe is ſo vaniſhed and diſperſed that now the light of Iuſtice doth cleerely appeare and ſhew it ſelfe in all parts of Ireland: and the office of a Iuſtice of Peace is duely
<pb facs="tcp:7522:4"/> regarded, and his Warrant in all parts of the Kingdome obeyed. So as now it will be needfull that the Iuſtice of Peace ſhould well underſtand the duty of his place, and neither exceede, nor come ſhort of the Authority given him, either by Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsion, or by the ſtatute Lawes of the Realme. And albeit divers worthy and learned men in England have publiſhed many profitable Bookes concerning the Pleas of the Crowne, and the Office of a Iuſtice of peace, yet none of thoſe will be any ſufficient guide for the Iuſtices of peace in Ireland, becauſe the Statute lawes of England and Ireland doe in many things differ: for there be many ancient Statutes made in England ſome whereof are in ſome things altered, and others repealed (either in part or in the whole) by later Statutes which are not of force in Ireland: (ſo as thoſe ancient Statutes as they were firſt enacted remaine ſtill of force in this Kingdome:) and likewiſe there be many ſtatutes made in Ireland (aſwell before 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. as ſince) which were never any lawes in England. The conſideration whereof hath incited me (although by reaſon of mine age, and other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties leaſt able of all my brethren the Iudges) for the helpe of the Iuſtices of peace here, to compoſe this worke according to the lawes and Statutes now of force in this Kingdome: which I humbly make bold to preſent to your Lordſhips view &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, not doubting but as all other labours which any way tend to the advancement of Iuſtice, &amp; the well ordering of this Common-wealth, ſo alſo theſe poore endevours of mine to that purpoſe vvill eaſily obtaine your favourable acceptance. Mine errors or miſtakings I ſhall humbly beſeech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to pardon &amp; impute them rather to my weakneſſe, want of abilitie, and multiplicitie of other imployments then to my will: and to accept of this ſmall mite as a free-vvill offering at the hands of him who for your Lordſhips many noble favors will not only ever pray for your happineſſe and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this place of governement, but alſo earneſtly deſire to manifeſt his thankfulnes for the ſame, and to be accounted</p>

                        <p n="11">11. Now firſt that the Iuſtices of peace are Iudges of Record,<note place="margin">9. E. 3. 4. 14. H. 8. 16.</note> (yea that every Iuſtice of peace by himſelfe is a Iudge of Record, and upon whoſe ſole report and teſtimony, the law repoſeth it ſelfe very much) appeareth more plainely if you obſerve theſe things following:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Hee is made under the great Seale, which is a matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Every Iuſtice of peace hath judiciall power given unto him by the Commiſſion, <hi>ſc.</hi> in the firſt <hi>aſsignavimus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Alſo by ſome ſtatutes they have judiciall power given them, for they may make a Record of a force by them viewed, and may thereupon fine and impriſon the offendors, yea one Iuſtice of peace may alſo heare and determine, and puniſh an offendor (in ſome caſes as convicted upon his owne view or examination) as in caſes of forcible Deteyner.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. His warrant (though it be beyond his authority) is not diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by the Conſtable, or other inferior Miniſter, but muſt be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and executed by them; But this muſt bee underſtood,<note place="margin">14. H. 8. 18. <hi>Co.</hi> 10. 7. 6.</note> when the Iuſtice of peace hath Iuriſdiction of the cauſe, for, or concerning which he hath granted his warrant; for otherwiſe the Conſtable or other Officer executing ſuch warrant is puniſhable notwithſtanding the warrant.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Hee may take a Recognizance (for the peace, &amp;c.) which is a matter of Record, and which none can doe, but a Iudge of Record, <hi>See Br. Recog.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp; 14.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. His record (or teſtimony) in ſome caſes is of as great force, and in ſome other caſes, of greater force, then an Indictment upon the oath of twelve men, as in caſes of Forcible Entry, forcible Detey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Riots.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Great cauſe therefore have the Iuſtices of P. to take heed that they abuſe not this their credit and authoritie, either to the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7522:20"/> of the ſubject, by making untrue Records, or defrauding of the King, by ſuppreſſing true Records.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Now concerning peace, it is the amitie, confidence, and quiet, that is betweene men, and he that breaketh this amitie, or quiet, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the peace.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Yet peace (in our law) moſt commonly is taken for an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from actuall and injurious force, and offer of violence, and ſo is rather a reſtraining of hands, then an uniting of mindes; And for the maintenance of this peace, chiefly were the Iuſtices of Peace firſt made.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. The breach of this peace ſeemeth to be any injurious force, or violence, moved againſt the perſon of another, his goods, lands or other poſſeſſions, whether it be by threatning words, or by furious geſture, or force of the bodie, or any other force uſed <hi>in terrorem populi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="15">15. The Office of the Iuſtice of Peace is principally to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to the ſuppreſſing of ſuch injurious and unlawfull force, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and yet the Commiſſion of the P. (being <hi>pro conſervatione pacis &amp; pro quieto regimine &amp; gubernatione populi,</hi>) I ſee not why the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Peace ſhould be reſtrained from preventing and repreſſing ſuch other offences, misbehaviours and deceits as may breake the amitie, quiet, and good governement of the people; and whereof diſcords, and ſo breaches of the peace doe often ariſe; (though there appeare neither force nor violence in the offence it ſelfe) as libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, coſinages, and ſuch other offences.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. But it is no part of their office to forbid lawfull ſuits; albeit they ſhall doe well to be mediators of peace in ſuch ſuites and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies as ſhall ariſe amongſt their neighbours.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. The Conſervation of the peace (and therein the care of the Iuſtice of peace) conſiſteth in three things, <hi>viz:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. In preventing the breach of the peace (wiſely fore-ſeeing and repreſſing the beginnings thereof) by taking ſurety for the keeping of it, or for the good behaviour of the offendors, as the caſe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In pacifying ſuch as are in breaking of the peace.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In puniſhing (according to the law) ſuch as have broken the peace.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. But of the three, the firſt; <hi>viz.</hi> the preventing part, is moſt worthy to be commended to the care of the Iuſtices of Peace.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. Iuſtices of peace (at this day) in Ireland are of two ſorts, and are appointed or created by two ſeverall meanes, <hi>videlicet:</hi> The one by grant made by the King by Charter under the great ſeale,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>By Charter.</hi> Br. Commiſſ. 5.</note> as Mayors and chiefe Officers in divers corporate Townes: And ſuch the King cannot diſcharge againe at his pleaſure, but they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and enjoy their Iuriſdiction, according as their Charters doe enable them: And therefore if the King grant to a Mayor or other

                        <p>Theſe two Commiſſions do ſomewhat differ in the ſecond <hi>Aſsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navimus,</hi> for by that for the County of Dublin, the Iuſtices of peace have power to heare and determine felonyes, but in the other they have no power given them thereby to heare and determine of any felonie, and the reaſon of this difference is twofold. Firſt becauſe, no Iuſtices of Aſſiſe and gaole delivery go into the County of Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. Secondly, becauſe at the quarter Seſſions of the peace there is alwayes one or more of the Iudges or of the Kings counſell preſent. Alſo both theſe Commiſſions do differ from the uſuall Commiſſion of the peace in England in this particular, <hi>videlicet.</hi> By theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, the Iuſtices of peace have power to enquire of Treaſon which the Iuſtices of peace in England by their Commiſſion have not. The reaſon is becauſe many offences which are common here, are by the Lawes of this kingdome Treaſon which by the Lawes in England are but felonie.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. Theſe Commiſſions have two parts containing the power of the Iuſtices of peace.</p>
                        <p n="34">
                           <note place="margin">Stat. Winch. 13. E. 1. 2. E. 3. 6. 2. E. 3. 3.</note>34. The firſt <hi>Aſsignavimus,</hi> or firſt part of the Commiſſion doth give power to any one Iuſtice of peace more, or all, to keepe and cauſe to be kept the peace, and all ordinances and ſtatutes made for the conſervation of the peace and for the quiet governement of the people: As namely the ſtatutes made for Huy and Cry after felons: And the ſtatutes made againſt Murtherers, Robbers, Felons, Night-walkers, Affrayers, Armour worne in <hi>terrorem.</hi> Riots, forceible Entries, and all other force and violence, All which be directly againſt the peace. The particulars thereof you ſhall finde more fully hereafter and moſt of them under their proper titles.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. By this firſt clauſe in the Commiſſion, the Iuſtices of peace have aſwell all the ancyent power touching the peace which the Conſervators of the peace had by the Common law, as alſo that whole authoritie which the ſtatutes have ſince added thereto.</p>
                        <p n="36">36. The meanes which the Iuſtices of peace muſt uſe for the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7522:24"/> keeping of the peace, and for the execution of theſe ſtatutes, is as followeth.</p>
                        <p n="37">37. For to prevent the breach of the peace the Iu. of P. may ſend his warrant for the party, and may take ſufficient ſureties of him by recognizance for the peace, or for the good behaviour, as the caſe ſhall require, and may ſend the partie to the Gaole for not finding ſuch ſureties.</p>
                        <p n="38">38. But for theſe ſtatutes made for the peace, they are to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted according to ſuch preſcript order as themſelves do deliver, wherein if no power at all be expreſſely given to any one Iuſtice of peace alone, then can he not otherwiſe compell the obſervation thereof (as it ſeemeth) then by admonition onely. In which behalfe if he ſhall not be obeyed, he may preferre the cauſe at the Seſſions and to worke it to a preſentment upon the ſtatute, and ſo by the help of his fellow Iuſtices to heare and determine thereof as law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
                        <p n="39">39. The ſecond <hi>Aſsignavimus,</hi> in the Commiſſion doth give au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to any two Iuſtices of the peace, or more, the one being of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> in theſe five things following.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To enquire, by a Iurie, of all offences mentioned within the Commiſſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To take and view all Iudictments and preſentments of the Iurie.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To grant out proces againſt the offendors, except in caſes of Treaſon, in the County of Dublin, and caſes of Treaſon and felonie in the other Counties, thereby to cauſe them to come and anſwere to the ſaid Iudictments.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. To trie and heare all ſuch offences (except before excepted) upon any former or future indictments taken before themſelves, or before any other Iuſtices of the peace after the offendors be come in.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. To determine thereof by giving Iudgement and inflicting puniſhment upon the offendors, according to the Lawes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
                        <p n="40">40. But all the buſines included within the ſecond <hi>Aſsignavimus,</hi> belongeth to the Seſſions of the peace, which is to be declared in the ſecond part of this booke, and therefore I forbeare to ſpeake of it in this place.</p>
                        <p n="41">41. Note alſo that there be diverſe ſtatutes, which be not ſpecified within the Commiſſion, and yet are committed to the charge and care of the Iuſtices of peace, and are a ſufficient warrant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of themſelves, although they be not recited in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And all ſuch ſtatutes are alſo to be executed, according as the ſame ſtatutes themſelves do ſeverally preſcribe and ſet downe.</p>
                        <p n="42">42. And for that moſt of the buſines and practiſe of the Iuſtices of peace doth conſiſt and lye in the execution of ſuch ſtatutes, as are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7522:25"/> committed to their charge (whether they be ſpecified in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or not ſpecified there) the numbers of which ſtatutes are exceedingly encreaſed of late yeares to the overburthening of all the Iuſtices of peace (And the rather) to give ſome little help to ſuch Iuſtices of peace who (being deſtitute of the aſſiſtance of ſuch as are learned in the Lawes) are daily to adminiſter Iuſtice (and to execute their office at home and out of their Seſſions) I have for their better caſe herein endeavored (in this treatiſe) to ſet downe more orderly and particularly the ſeverall parts and branches of every ſuch ſtatute by it ſelfe, under their proper titles, with further referments to the ſtatutes themſelves at large or to the Abridgements.</p>
                        <p n="43">43. The power and authoritie of the Iuſtices of peace aſwell given them by the ſaid Commiſſion, as by the ſtatutes, is in ſome caſes Miniſteriall or regular and limited as a Miniſter onely; And in ſome other caſes judiciall or abſolute and as a Iudge.</p>
                        <p n="44">44. Miniſteriall, when he is thereto commaunded by a higher authoritie.</p>
                        <p n="45">45. As upon A <hi>ſupplicavit</hi> out of the Chancery or Kings Bench, for the taking of ſuretie for the peace, or good behaviour; and a Writ upon the ſtatute of North-hampton, upon a forceible Entrie.</p>
                        <p>In the execution of which two Writs the Iuſtice of peace may proceede no further, or otherwiſe then hee is authoriſed by ſuch writ, and is alſo to returne the writ, and to certifie his doings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, into the Court whence the writ came.</p>
                        <p n="46">46. But in all other caſes the power of the Iuſtices of peace is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute (in ſome manner) ſo as they, and every of them may of their owne power proceede <hi>ex officio,</hi> and as a Iudge; yet this their power is alſo limited, for they may neither hang a man for a treſpaſſe, nor fine him for a felony, but muſt proceede in all things according as they are preſcribed by the Commiſſion, and by the ſaid ſeverall ſtatutes.</p>
                        <p n="47">47. And yet, for that all Conſiderable circumſtances can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be comprehended in the Commiſſion,<note place="margin">Diſcretion.</note> nor fore-ſeene at the time of the making of the ſtatutes. Therefore oftentimes ſome things are referred to the conſideration of the Iuſtices of peace, and left to be ſupplyed by them in their diſcretion.</p>

                        <p n="6">6. There be ſome other ſtatutes and ſome other caſes wherein the diſcretion of the Iuſtices of peace (out of their Seſſions) is tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

                        <p n="7">7. Alſo the ſayings of the late reverend Iudge and Sage of the Law (in his fifth part in <hi>Rooks</hi> caſe,<note place="margin">Co. li. 5. fo. 100. &amp; li. 10. fo. 140.</note> and in his tenth part in <hi>Keighleys</hi> caſe) are worthy obſervation, <hi>ſc.</hi> That diſcretion is a knowledge or underſtanding to diſcerne betweene truth and falſhood, betweene right and wrong, betweene ſhaddowes and ſubſtance, betweene Equity and colourable gloſſes and pretences, and not to doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our wills and private affections, for <hi>talis diſcretio diſcretionem confundit.</hi> And therefore in both the recited caſes it was holden, that though the words in the Commiſſion of Sewers do give authoritie to thoſe Commiſſioners to do according to their diſcretions, that yet their diſcretion and proceedings ought to be limited and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the rules of reaſon, Law, and Iuſtice. Againe, diſcretion (ſaith he) is <hi>ſcire per legem quid ſit justum.</hi> And therefore every Iudge, Iuſtice, or Commiſſioner ought to have <hi>duos ſales, viz. Salem ſapientiae, ne ſit inſipidus.

                        <p n="9">9. In all caſes therefore where the ſtatutes do referre the Triall of offendors (or hearing and determining of offences) to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iuſtice or Iuſtices of peace (out of Seſſions) it is very requiſite that upon ſuch tryall or hearing the ſaid Iuſtices take due examination of the offendors themſelves, or of credible witneſſes, (aſwell concerning the fact it ſelfe, as the circumſtances thereof,) and upon confeſſion or other due proofe of the offence.

                        <p n="11">11. Note further that the Iuſtices of peace out of their Seſſions, are now armed with farre more ample authority and power than the ancient Conſervators of the peace were. For the Iuſtices of peace have double power given them. The one of Iuriſdiction to convent the offendors before them by their warrant (in diverſe caſes) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, heare, and determine the cauſe. The other of coertion, (<hi>ſc.</hi> that after the cauſe hard) to conſtraine them to the obedience and obſervance of their order and decree, which notwithſtanding muſt be according to the rules of Law and Iuſtice as aforeſaid.

                           <note place="margin">Plo. 37.</note>And here I muſt further put the Iuſtices of peace in minde, that their authoritie and power is limited to be by them exerciſed, only within the County or Countyes where they be in Commiſſion; And yet in that or thoſe County or Countyes, the Iuſtices of peace of the County muſt not intermedle in any City there, which is a County of it ſelfe.

                        <p n="14">14. Neither ſhall any Iuſtice of peace deale in, or puniſh any treſpaſſe,<note place="margin">Vbi quis delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet ibi puniet.</note> or other like offence, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in any other County (againſt any penall ſtatute) though ſuch offendor ſhalbe brought before him; Except the ſtatute ſhall ſpecially enable them thereto, or that it be

                        <p n="15">15. Neither ſhall any Iuſtice of peace for the time that he ſhall make his abode or be out of the County where he is in Commiſſion, exerciſe his office: For being out of the County where he is in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he is but a private man.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. Now my purpoſe is to ſet downe more particularly what things Iuſtices of peace out of their Seſſions of the peace may do in the execution of their Commiſſion, or of the ſtatutes wherewith they are charged. And herein you muſt obſerve that ſome things are permitted to be executed by any one, two, or more Iuſtices, either in regard that ſuch Iuſtice or Iuſtices is or are next to the place, or are of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> or the like.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. And here note that whatſoever any one Iuſtice of peace alone may doe (either for the keeping of the peace, or in other exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Commiſſion or ſtatutes) the ſame alſo may lawfully be done and performed by any two, or more Iuſtices.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. But where the Law giveth authority to Two,<note place="margin">Co. li. 4. fo. 46.</note> there one alone cannot execute this, for <hi>una perſona non poteſt ſupplere vicem duarum. Et plus vident Oculi quam oculus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="19">19. Alſo when things by ſtatute are appropriated to ſome one certaine Iuſtice, or to more,<note place="margin">Co. li. 11. fo. 92.</note> there ſuch Iuſtice or Iuſtices are to purſue ſuch their authoritie accordingly, for where an authoritie is given to foure, or to one of them, if two of them ſhall execute this, it ſeemeth they have not purſued their authoritie.</p>
                        <p n="20">20.<note place="margin">Plo. fo. 206. 6.</note> Beſides there ſeemeth a generall rule to be put in <hi>Stradlings</hi> caſe (in M. <hi>Plo.</hi>) that when a thing is appointed by any ſtatute to be done by, or before one perſon,<note place="margin">See.

But that it ought to be done as the ſtatute hath appointed, and by ſuch expreſſe deſignation of one, or power given to one certaine perſon, all others are excluded.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. And in ſuch things appropriate to ſome one or more Iuſtices of peace, if without ſuch Iuſtice or Iuſtices, all (or any of) the reſidue of the Iuſtices of that County ſhall intermedle therein.

                        <note place="margin">What.</note>1. AN arreſt is the apprehending, and firſt reſtrayning of a mans perſon, depriving it of his owne will and liberty, and may be called the beginning of Impriſonment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Impriſonment is where a man is arreſted againſt his will, and is reſtrained of his libertie, by putting him into the Gaole, cage, or Stocks, or into ſome houſe, or otherwiſe by keeping him in the high
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7522:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtreet, or open field, ſo as he cannot freely goe at libertie, when and whither he would.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">By Parol.</note> Now concerning the precepts and warrants made by the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of peace.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Iuſtice of peace (ſeeing that he is a Iudge of Record) his precept or Commandement by word of mouth, in ſome caſes is as ſtrong as his precept in writing.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And therefore the Iuſtice of peace upon a Riot done in his preſence, may command the Riotters to be arreſted, and cauſe them to finde ſureties for their good behaviour.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. So upon an Affray, aſſault, threatning, or other breach of the peace done in his preſence, the Iuſtice of peace may command by word the Officer being preſent, or his owne ſervant to arreſt ſuch offendors, to finde ſureties for the peace.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And where the Iuſtice of peace commandeth one being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to arreſt another that is alſo in his preſence,<note place="margin">14. H. 7. 8, 9.</note> though that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement be by word only, it is good, and it is reputed as an arreſt made by the Iuſtice himſelfe, he being preſent when the arreſt is made.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But the Iuſtice of peace cannot command by word,<note place="margin">14. H. 7. 8.</note> to arreſt another being out of his preſente, neither may one in the abſence of the Iuſtice arreſt another upon his command by paroll,<note place="margin">Br. peace. 7.</note> but it muſt be by a precept, or warrant in writing.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Next the warrant or precept of a Iuſtice of peace by writing<note place="margin">By writing.</note> ought to be under his hand and ſeale, or under his hand at leaſt.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And if it be for the peace or good behaviour, or the like, where ſureties are to be found or required, There the warrant ought to containe the ſpeciall cauſe and matter whereupon it is granted, to the intent that the party upon whom it is to be ſerved, may provide his ſureties ready and take them with him to the Iu. of peace to be bound for him. But if the warrant be for Treaſon, murder or felony, or other capitall offence, or for great conſpiracies, rebellions, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, or the like, it needs not containe any ſpeciall cauſe, but there the warrant of the Iu. of peace may be to bring the party before him to make anſwere to ſuch things or matters generally as ſhalbe objected againſt him, on the Kings Majeſties behalfe,<note place="margin">Cromp. 148.</note> and this is now the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſage.</p>

                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:7522:29"/>13. Alſo the Iuſtice of peace may in ſome caſes make his warrant to attach the offendor to be at the next Seſſions of the peace, there to anſwere his ſaid offence.</p>

                        <note place="margin">For what cauſe.</note>14. A Iuſtice of peace <hi>(ex officio)</hi> by the the firſt <hi>Aſsignavimus</hi> in the Commiſſion, may grant his warrant to arreſt or attach one that hath broken the peace, or committed other miſdemeanour againſt the peace, to find ſureties for the peace or good behaviour.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Alſo the Iuſtices of peace in diverſe caſes (as the caſe ſhall require) do uſe to grant their warrant againſt a man for his neglect, or other default, as for refuſing to pay Country or Towne Rates and the like, and is warranted by the firſt <hi>Aſsignavimus</hi> of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it is <hi>pro bono regimine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. And ſuch warrant may be either to attach the offendor to be at the next Seſſions, there to anſwer &amp;c. or els to bring the offendor before the ſaid Iu. or any other Iuſtice, &amp;c. who finding cauſe, may bind ſuch an offendor to appeare at the next Seſſions, to anſwer the ſaid default.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Alſo whereſoever any ſtatute doth give authority to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of peace to cauſe another perſon to do a thing, there it ſeemeth, they have power given them (of congruity) to grant their warrant to bring ſuch perſon before them, that ſo they may take order therein.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Alſo a Iuſtice of peace may grant his warrant to attach per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuſpected of felony or Treaſon, and that by the firſt <hi>Aſsignavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> in the Commiſſion, and by the true conſtruction of the ſtatute of 5. <hi>Ed. 3. 14.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. Againe, if a felony or Treaſon be committed, there is no doubt but that every private man without a warrant may arreſt whomſoever he ſuſpecteth of it, being a man of evill fame, &amp;c. But if the offendor being purſued ſhall reſiſt, who ſhalbe ayding to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man whoſe goods are ſtolne, and who ſuſpecteth another to have ſtolne them, either to ſearch for his goods or to apprehend the party ſuſpected, if the Iuſtice of peace by this warrant ſhall not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the Conſtable to ayde him therein. If it be objected that the Conſtable may do all this of his owne authority (upon requeſt to him made by the party robbed) it is true, and yet we find by common experience that the Conſtables wihout the Iuſtices warrant therein, are for the moſt part, both very fearefull and alſo remiſſe, as neither knowing their owne authoritie, nor the danger.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Beſides, his is no new thing, for there is ſuch a preſident in the old booke of Iuſtices of peace (impreſſ. 1561. <hi>F. 41. a.</hi>) and it is the Common practiſe at this day, and ſeemeth to be very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, that they exerciſe not the office of a Iuſtice of peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have taken the oath of their office, and the oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they execute not this their office in their owne caſe, but

                     <p n="3">3. That they be carefull for the execution of the ſtatute of Riots, and if upon their enquiry of a Riot, the truth cannot bee found by reaſon of any maintenance, &amp;c. that they certifie the ſame within one moneth to the Lord Deputy and Counſell, according to the ſtatute of 13. <hi>H. 4. ca. 7.</hi>

                     <p n="8">8. Further the Iu. of P. are to be carefull that they ſuffer not the King to be diſadvantaged where it lyeth lawfully in their power to prevent.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Alſo that they remember, how that they exerciſe not the judgements of men only but of God himſelfe (whoſe power they doe participate, and who is alwayes preſent with them) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt take heed, that in all their actions they ſet God continually before their Eyes.</p>

For (as <hi>Sir Edw.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>BAilement, Mainpriſe,</hi> or <hi>Replevin,</hi> is the ſaving or delivery of a man, out of priſon, before that he hath ſatisfied the Law <hi>ſc.</hi> by finding ſureties to anſwere, and be juſtified by the Law. And to this purpoſe theſe three termes (Bailement, Mainpriſe, and Replevin) be indifferently uſed in our ſtatutes and bookes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He that is bayled,<note place="margin">Stamf. 65.</note> is taken or kept out of priſon and delivered (as it were) into the hands of his ſureties, who are reputed his guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and who may keepe him with them,<note place="margin">F.

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. By the common law the Sheriffe, and every Conſtable (being conſervators of the peace) might have bailed a ſuſpect of felony, but this authoritie is taken from them, and given to the Iuſtices of peace by theſe ſtatutes following:</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Firſt by the ſtatute, <hi>1. R. 3. cap. 3.</hi> every Iuſtice of peace had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (by his diſcretion) to let to bayle perſons impriſoned for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition of felony. But foraſmuch as after the making of that ſtatute, diverſe not being baileable, were notwithſtanding let to Bayle,<note place="margin">Two Iuſtices.</note> and ſo many notable felons eſcaped, therefore this ſtatute was repealed by the ſtatute of <hi>3. H. 7.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. H. 7. cap. 38 Fitz. Na. Br. 251. f.</note> And thereby any two Iuſtices of peace (the one being of the <hi>Quorum</hi>) were enabled to let any priſoners (mainpernable by the Law) to baile to the next generall Seſſions of the peace or gaole delivery, as the caſe ſhould require. After, for that one Iuſtice of peace in the name of himſelfe, and of one other of his fellow Iuſtices (not making the other Iuſtice privie unto the cauſe, wherefore the priſoner ſhould be bailed) did oftentimes by ſiniſter meanes ſet at large great and notable offendors, ſuch as were not baileable, and yet to hide their affection therein, did ſignifie the cauſe of their apprehenſion to be but onely for a ſuſpition of felony, whereby the ſaid offendors have eſcaped unpuniſhed, for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof by the ſtatute <hi>10. Carol. cap. 18.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">10. Carol. 18.</note> in Ireland it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, that if it be for Manſlaughter, or felony, or ſuſpition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7522:36"/> or felony, in which caſes the party is baileable, then the ſame Iuſtices muſt be preſent together at the time of the ſaid baile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that they muſt certifie (in writing ſubſcribed with their owne hands) the ſaid Bailement at the next generall gaole delivery to be holden within the County where the perſon ſhall be arreſted, or ſuſpected (upon paine to be fined by the Iuſtices of gaole deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.) Now by the preamble of both laſt recited ſtatutes, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe ſeemeth to bee the eſcape of felons, and therefore if it be not in caſe of felony, it ſeemeth any one Iuſtice of peace alone, may baile a priſoner, except where ſome particular ſtatute ſhall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſcribe.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Cromp. 1 57.</note>5. If the Mainpernors, or ſureties, doe at any time, or in any caſe doubt that their priſoner, or the party by them bailed, will flie, they may take him and bring him before any Iuſtice of peace, and upon their prayer the ſaid Iu. of P. may diſcharge ſuch ſureties and commit the party to priſon, except he ſhall finde new ſureties ſuch as the Iuſtices ſhall conceive to be ſufficient; So if a priſoner be bailed by inſufficient perſons, the Iu. of P. <hi>(ex officio)</hi> may cauſe him to finde better ſureties, and may commit him till he ſhall ſo doe, for the ſtatute of <hi>Weſtm. 1. ca. 15.</hi> requireth that ſuch as be bailed, be let out by ſufficient ſureties. And although the number, of ſuch ſureties, their ſufficiency, and the ſumme wherein they ſhalbe bound, reſteth in ſome ſort, in the diſcretion of the Iu. yet it is ſafe for them to take two ſureties, at the leaſt, and thoſe to be men of good ability, eſpecially if the priſoner be in for felony or ſuſpition thereof; For if the Iuſtices let out a priſoner upon inſufficient ſureties that is committed for ſuſpition of felony, and appeareth not, they ſhalbe fined by the Iuſtices of Aſſiſe and gaole delivery.</p>

Now Bailement, by the Iuſtices of peace (in caſe of felony or for any other matter) is alwaies upon a certaine ſumme of mony (as upon 40<hi rend="sup">1</hi> &amp;c.) the which ſumme the ſureties, &amp;c. ſhall forfeit to the K. if it the priſoner appeare not at his day, And in this buſineſſe of bailement (being a matter of much weight) It behooveth the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of peace to be very circumſpect aſwell for feare of wrong, by denying it to him, that is baileable, as alſo for feare of danger to the ſervice it ſelfe, by yeelding it where it is not grantable, and for feare of danger to themſelves in both caſes.<note place="margin">3.

                     <p n="1">1. BUrglarie is when one or more in the night time doe breake a dwelling houſe, or a Church, or the walls or gates of a City,<note place="margin">22. E. 3. Dalton 231.</note> or walled Towne, with an intent to doe felony, although he or they carry away nothing, yet it is felony of death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Firſt for the time,<note place="margin">Br. Cor. 125. Stamf. 30. Co. 11. 36.</note> Burglary cannot be committed in the day time, but only in the night, for all indictments of Burglary be <hi>Quod noctantur fregit.</hi> And the night to this purpoſe, beginneth at the Sun ſetting, and continueth to the Sun riſing; And therefore to breake a houſe, &amp;c. after the Sun ſetting, and before it be darke, or after day light in Summer, and before the Sun riſeth, is Burglarie.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Next,<note place="margin">Stamf. 30. Dyer. 99. Br. Cor. 106.</note> for the manner it is holden (by ſome good opinions) that if a man breake the houſe to doe felony, and yet entreth not, it is no Burglary, and that the indictment muſt be <hi>fregit &amp; intravit,</hi> And yet by the opinion of <hi>Shard. 27. Aſſ. 38.</hi> and by the opinions of Sir <hi>Anthony Browne,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Montague,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Brooke</hi> late chiefe Iuſtice of the common pleas,<note place="margin">Cromp. 31. 32. 33.</note> and others (as Maiſter <hi>Crompton</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth) if a man doe but attempt or enterpriſe to breake or enter into a dwelling houſe by night, to the intent to rob, or kill any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there, though he make no actuall entry there, yet it is a full and compleat Burglary, for if he doe but put in his hand or foot, it is an entrie in Law, although his whole body were not in; Alſo to put backe the leafe of a window with his dagger, to draw the latch of the doore, to turne but the key being on the Inner ſide of the doore, or to breake the glaſſe window and to draw out any goods there with a hooke, &amp;c. or to breake a hole in the wall,<note place="margin">Dalton pag. 231. &amp; 232.</note> and to ſhoote in thereby at any in the houſe, in all theſe caſes it is Burglary.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. So likewiſe (the doore being opened by ſome of the houſe) if any the attempters ſhall diſcharge a dag againſt any in the houſe, and in diſcharging his dag ſhall hold his hand over the threſhold though he ſet no foot over, this is Burglary: So if upon attempt of Burglary, they within the houſe ſhall caſt out their money for feare,<note place="margin">Dalton ib.</note> and the attempters take it away, in all theſe caſes it is Burglary, and yet there is no actuall entrie made, in any of theſe caſes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But if a Theefe ſetteth but his foot over the threſhold or into any part of the houſe to commit felony, this much more ſhall convict him of Burglary.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">Cromp. 32.</note> Alſo one being let downe the Chimney in the night to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit felony,<note place="margin">Dalton ib.</note> it was adjudged burglary by Sir <hi>Roger Manwood</hi> chiefe Baron, and yet he broke not the houſe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. So is it to come into a houſe by the helpe of a key, or ſuddenly to come into the houſe by night, the doores being open, and the owner flyeth to his chamber, and the offendor is taken ſhoving at the chamber doore.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:7522:57"/>8. So it is likewiſe if Theeves pretending that they bee robbed, &amp;c. ſhall come to the Conſtable, and pray him to make ſearch for the felons, and going with the Conſtable into a mans houſe to ſearch they rob the good man of the houſe, this is Burglary.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <note place="margin">21. El.</note>9. In like manner if a ſervant conſpiring with another to rob his maſter, ſhall open his maſters doore, or window in the night and the other entreth thereat,<note place="margin">Dalton ib.</note> this is Burglary in the ſtranger, by the opinion of Sir <hi>Roger Manwood,</hi> who was an ingenious and learned Iudge, and yet the houſe was not broken in any of theſe caſes.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. But if one commeth into a houſe in the day and there hideth himſelfe till night and then ſtealeth any thing out of the houſe, or if any that is lodged in a houſe in the night goeth out of the houſe, and ſtealeth ſome of the goods yet this is no Burglarie but only fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, for that he broke not the houſe, the firſt of theſe two caſes was reſolved at <hi>Derby, Aſſ. 32.

                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. Alſo if diverſe come to commit Burglarie, and but one of them entreth and commits it,<note place="margin">11. H. 4. 13.</note> the reſt ſtanding about the houſe, or not farre of to watch that no helpe ſhall come, this is Burglary in all that company.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <note place="margin">The place.</note>12. Now concerning the place, it may be either publique or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, publique as the Church, or walls, or gates, of a City or walled Towne, private as a dwelling houſe, and here commonly it is no Burglarie, unleſſe ſome perſon be at that time within the houſe, And yet if a man hath a dwelling houſe and he and all his family (upon ſome occaſion) are part of the night out of the houſe,<note place="margin">Co. 4. 40.</note> and in the meane time one commeth and breaketh the houſe to commit felony, this is Burglary.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. So if a man hath two dwelling houſes, and ſometimes dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at the one,<note place="margin">Co. 4. 40.</note> and ſometimes at the other, and hath a family or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in both, and in the night when his ſervants are out of the houſe the houſe is broken by Theeves; this is Burglary adjudged. <hi>38.

If one breaketh a chamber in any Innes of Court or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery or in any Colledge in a univerſity in the night, to the intent to commit felony there, this is Burglary, although there were no perſon in the ſame Chamber, For that Colledges and houſes of Court and Chancery be entire houſes, whereof ſuch chamber is parcell; ſo that if any perſon ſhall be in any other chamber within the ſame houſe or Colledge at the ſame time it is Burglary.</p>

                        <note place="margin">2. Ed. 6. Br. Cor. 180. Lamb. 156.</note>15. Alſo the breaking (in the night) of a Stable, Barne, or other out houſe, adjoyning, or neere to the dwelling houſe, to the intent to ſteale, is Burglary though he take nothing.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. At Summer Aſſizes at Cambridge <hi>Anno Domini 1616.</hi> two men were arraigned and condemned for Burglary before Sir <hi>Iames Altham</hi> Knight for robbing a Backhouſe of <hi>Robert Caſtle Eſquire</hi> in the night,<note place="margin">Dalton pag. 293.</note> which Backhouſe was ſome eight or nine yards diſtant from his dwelling houſe and only a pale reaching betweene them: ſo that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7522:57"/> though this offence be not committed in the very body of the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſe, but in ſome other houſe neere unto it, and being parcell of or belonging to the dwelling houſe, it is Burglary.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. But a Booth or Tent in a Faire or market, are not eſteemed in Law for dwelling houſes,<note place="margin">Co. 11. 37.</note> nor the breaking thereof in the night time to be Burglary, although the robbing of them bee made as penall as Burglarie, if the owner, his wife, children or ſervants were within the ſame.</p>

H. 7. 4. F. Coro. 267.</note> And therefore to breake a houſe in the night to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to kill any perſon therein, it is Burglary, although hee never touch him.</p>
                     <p>So it is, if the purpoſe were to rob,<note place="margin">F Cor. 185. &amp; 264.</note> although the offendor taketh away nothing.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. LArcenie (being fetched from the latine word <hi>Latrocinium</hi>) is properly a fraudulent and felonious taking away of another mans perſonall goods, in the abſence of the owner and without his knowledge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is of two ſorts, Grand Larceny which is felony of death and Pety Larceny which is forfeiture of goods and Chattels, and corporall puniſhment at the diſcretion of the Iudges.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Grand Larceny,<note place="margin">Grand Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceny.</note> is when the goods ſtollen be above the value of xij.d. and this is felony of death <hi>ſc.</hi> wherein Iudgement of death ſhall be given upon the offendor, except he be ſaved by his booke.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And yet if the goods ſtollen be to the value of ten ſhillings,<note place="margin">F. <hi>Cor.</hi> 451.</note> if the Iury that paſſeth upon his arraignement ſhall finde that the goods did not exceed the value of xij.d. then that offence ſhall be taken but for Pety Larceny.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.<note place="margin">Pety Larceny. Weſt. 1. c. 15. Br. Cor. 84. &amp; 85.</note> Pety Larceny is when the goods ſtollen doe not exceede the value of xij.d. and for this the offendor ſhall be impriſoned for ſome certaine time, and after ſhall be whipped, or otherwiſe puniſhed by the diſcretion of the Iuſtices before whom he was arraigned, but it is not felony of death.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Yet may not the Iuſtice of peace before whom ſuch an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſhall be brought (out of the Seſſions) puniſh by his diſcretion the ſaid offendor for Pety Larceny and ſo let him goe, but muſt commit him to priſon or baile him, to the intent he may come to his triall as in caſe of other felonies, and if upon his triall the Iurie ſhall finde the goods ſtollen, to exceede xij.d. in value, the offendor ſhall have Iudgement to dye for the fault.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Although Pety Larceny be not puniſhable by death,<note place="margin">29. H. 8. 22. F. Coro. 218. Br Cor. 2. 84. 85. &amp; 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="8">8. If one ſhall ſteale goods to the value of 4.<note place="margin">F. Coro. 415. Stamf 24. Crom. 36. 2.</note>d. at one time and vj.d. at another time, and of iij.d. at another time which together
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7522:60"/> doe exceede the value of xij.d. and that theſe ſeverall goods be all ſtollen from one and the ſame perſon, then may they be put together in one Indictment, and the offendor, being thereupon arraigned and found guilty, ſhall have judgement of death.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <note place="margin">F. Coro. 440. Stamf. 24. 1.</note>9. Againe, if two or more together doe ſteale goods above the value of 12. d. this is felony of death in them all, for the felony in them is ſeverall, though the ſtealing be joyntly done.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. In Larcenie two things muſt concurre, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to take, and to carry away,<note place="margin">The manner.</note> or remove the thing taken, with a purpoſe to ſteale the ſame, for the indictment muſt be, <hi>Cepit &amp; aſportavit,</hi> or <hi>cepit &amp; abduxit,</hi> and yet in theſe words, the letter is not ſo much to be inſiſted upon, as the meaning, and that for the better ſuppreſſing of offendours in this kinde. For although by the Law in Maiſter <hi>Glanvils</hi> time <hi>à fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to omnimodo excuſatur, qui initium habuerit ſuae detentionis, per dominum illius rei,</hi> yet at this day it may be felony, though the offendour take not the thing, but comes firſt unto it by delivery from the owners owne hand, and ſo commeth lawfully to the poſſeſſion. As if a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verner doe ſet a peece of plate before his gueſt to drinke in,<note place="margin">13 Ed. 4 9. Stamf. 25.</note> and the gueſt carrieth it away, this is felony, for the Taverner gave him no poſſeſſion thereof, but onely the uſe to drinke in it for the time. Or if I deliver goods to a Carrier, or other perſon, and bargaine with him to carry them to a certaine place appointed, if he carrieth them to the place, and then convayeth them away fraudulently, this is fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, for the privity of bailement was determined when they came at the place appointed. So if the Carrier ſhall take out parcell of the goods, this is felony; and likewiſe if the Carrier ſhall carry them to another place, and there breaketh them up, and converteth part, or all, to his owne uſe, this is felony; but if the Carrier ſhall ſell or give away, or otherwiſe imbezell the whole, as he received them, this is holden to be no felony, becauſe it was delivered him in the ſame kinde. <hi>Stamf. 25. a.

                     <p n="11">11. And yet in this laſt caſe there is beſides the delivery a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and agreement to carry the goods, and the delivery was only to that intent, ſo that the property of thoſe goods did alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the firſt owner. But if A. lendeth his horſe to B. being a ſtranger, who rideth quite away with the horſe, this is no felony in B. by reaſon of the delivery. And ſo did Sir <hi>Iohn Dodderidge</hi> Knight give direction at Cambridge Aſſiſes, 1617. upon an Indictment of Felony preferred in ſuch a caſe.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. If a Clothier ſhall deliver any Wooll or Yarne to his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Spinſter, or Weaver, &amp;c. to dreſſe, and they ſhall convay away, imbezell or ſell any part thereof, this ſeemeth to be no felony, by reaſon of the delivery.</p>

                        <note place="margin">13. Ed 4. 9.</note>13. So if I deliver my goods to another to keepe, and he fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently conſumeth them, or otherwiſe converteth them to his owne profit, this is no felony, becauſe of the delivery.</p>

                     <p n="16">16. And now upon the conſtruction of this ſtat. diverſe new que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and caſes have ſince beene moved.<note place="margin">Dyer. 5.</note> As if a man deliver an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to his ſervant to goe and receive the money thereupon due, and the ſervant receiveth the money and then goeth away therewith, or doth convert it to his owne uſe, this is holden to be no felony within the meaning of this ſtatute for the Maſter did not deliver the money to his ſervant; So if a man delivers to his ſervant wares,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or cattell to ſell at Faire or market, and he ſelleth them there, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the money, and then goeth away with the money, or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it to his owne uſe, this is no felony within this ſtatute, for hee had not the money by his maſters delivery,<note place="margin">Dyer. 5.</note> neither went hee away with the goods his maſter delivered him.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. But if the ſervant received of his maſter 20. l. in gold to keep,<note place="margin">28. El.

Then the Iuſt. of P. may enter, and ſearch whether there be any force of Armour, or weapon worne or borne, againſt this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, or otherwiſe, he may inquire thereof by a Iury, for ſo the writ it ſelfe doth warrant him; And if after proclamation any ſuch be found, he ought to impriſon the offendors, and to ſeiſe to the K. uſe and preiſe (by the oathes of ſome preſent) the armour and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons ſo found with them, and the offendors ſo impriſoned are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in priſon untill that ſome other commandement bee given concerning them from his Majeſtie, <hi>viz.</hi> by writ out of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But if upon the Proclamation made they doe depart in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, then hath the Iuſt. no warrant by the writ to commit

But when the Iuſtice hath removed the force (upon his writ) he may not put the party that was put out,<note place="margin">Cromp. 74. 162.</note> in poſſeſſion againe, for if he doe, it ſeemeth both the Iuſtice, and the party alſo are puniſhable in the Starchamber, for the writ doth authoriſh the Iuſtice onely to remove the force, and not to make reſtitution.</p>

                     <p n="51">51. The manner to execute this ſtatute, by the Iuſtice of peace <hi>(ex officio)</hi> ſeemeth to be all one, as before, where he hath a writ deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him, ſaving that when he doth this <hi>ex officio</hi> and without writ, he needeth not to make any proclamation, nor to ſend any certificate into the Chancery. But the Iuſtice may goe to the place where the force is, and if it be in a houſe may enter, and ſearch if any force of Armour, or weapon be worne and borne againſt this ſtatute. And if any ſuch offendors be found, he may commit them to priſon and may ſeiſe and preiſe the Armour and weapon ſo found with them, and he ought to record all that which he ſhall doe in this behalfe and the ſame to Eſtreate into the Exchequer that the King may be anſwered of the Armour, or of the value thereof.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. But here againe the Iuſtice muſt not make any reſtitution of the poſſeſſion to the party ouſted but muſt only remove the force.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. OUr Law taketh knowledge of two manners of force, the one may be termed a force in judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Law, which accompteth every private Treſpaſſe to be a force, ſo as if I doe but paſſe over another mans ground without licence, he may have his action of Treſpaſſe againſt me, <hi>Quare vi &amp; armis, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other manner of force is more apparant, and alwayes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth ſome fearefull ſhew, and matter of terror with it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This laſt ſort of force is, that which is prohibited by theſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and therefore note that every force, puniſhable by theſe ſtatutes muſt have one of theſe two badges, <hi>ſc.</hi> it muſt be either <hi>Manuforti,</hi> or <hi>multitudine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Manuforti, ſc.</hi> either with apparent violence (in deed,<note place="margin">Dalton p. 177.</note> or word) offered to the perſon of another: as threatning ſpeeches, turbulent behaviour, or actuall violence; or elſe that they be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with offenſive weapons, by them not uſually borne; and this may be done by one perſon onely.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Multitudine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">10. H. 7. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>ſc.</hi> with company more than uſually they have attending on them, <hi>10. H. 7. 12.</hi> The law properly calleth it a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when there be three or moe in one company.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If therefore one,<note place="margin">Forceible Entrie.</note> or moe perſons ſhall come weaponed (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with weapons not uſually borne) to a houſe or land, and ſhall violently enter thereinto, this is a forceible Entrie within the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe ſtatutes.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Much more if (being ſo entred) hee or they ſhall there offer violence, or feare of harme,<note place="margin">Dalton p. 177.</note> to the perſon of any that is in poſſeſſion thereof; moſt of all, if he or they ſhall forceibly and furiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and drive another out of ſuch his poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. So is it if one ſhall enter peaceably (the doore being open,<note place="margin">Dalton ibid.</note> or onely latched,) and after he is in the houſe, he ſhall forceibly put another out of his poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:7522:82"/>
                        <note place="margin">Dalton ibid.</note>9. So is it if he or they that ſhall enter peaceably, ſhall after their Entrie offer apparant violence, threatnings, or feare of harme to the perſon of any that is in poſſeſſion, to the intent to get him out, and to make him leave the poſſeſſion, though they doe not put him out of poſſeſſion, much more if they get the poſſeſſion thereby.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If he or they that have entred peaceably, ſhall after uſe words to any in poſſeſſion to this effect,<note place="margin">Dalton pa. 178.</note> as to ſay they will hold or keepe it, though they die for it, or in ſpight of the other, or ſuch like, or other threatning words, this maketh it a forceible Entrie.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. So it is if diverſe perſons ſhall come with weapons (not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally borne by them) to a houſe that is open,<note place="margin">Cromp. 69.</note> or to ground, and ſhall there enter peaceably without any diſturbance, yet this is a forceible Entry, for it ſhall bee intended that they would have uſed force, if they had been reſiſted.</p>

                        <note place="margin">10. H. 7. 12. Br. force 30.</note>12. So it is when the Maſter entreth into an houſe or land, being attended with a greater number of ſervants than uſually doe wait on him.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Note that though a man doe actually uſe no force in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet if he doe come ſo appointed, either with weapon, or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that other men may be reaſonably afraid that he mindeth to make his way by force,<note place="margin">Dalton ibid.</note> rather then he will faile of his purpoſe, it ſeemeth to be a forceible Entrie.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Alſo it ſeemeth that every Entrie into another mans houſe, or ground which is made with force (<hi>ſc. manuforti,</hi>

                     <p n="15">15. But if the Entrie were peaceable, and after ſuch Entry made, they cut or take away any other mans Corne,<note place="margin">Dalton ibid.</note> graſſe, wood or other goods without apparant violence, or force, though ſuch Acts are accounted a Diſſeiſin with force, yet they ſeeme not to be puniſhable by theſe ſtatutes: <hi>ſc.</hi> the Iuſtices of peace are not to remove, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or fine ſuch offendors.</p>

                     <p n="19">19. As I conceive there is no doubt, but that the Iuſtices of peace (without the Sheriffe or underſheriffe) upon all riots, may and ought firſt to goe to the place, and ſuch riotters as they ſhall ſee or finde riotouſly aſſembled, they may and ought to arreſt and to take away their armour and weapons, and to remove the riotters, and may cauſe them to finde ſureties for the peace, or good behaviour, and for want of ſuch ſureties may commit them to the gaole, all which any one Iuſtice of peace may doe.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. The Iuſtice of peace may examine upon their oathes the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerning their ſufficiency,<note place="margin">Br. imp. 18.</note> and that ſeemeth to be the uſage in the Courts at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Crompton</hi> ſaith, that the Iuſtices of peace in their Seſſions may doe it. <hi>Cromp. 194.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The moſt uſuall manner, and ſafeſt way for the Iuſtice of peace is to take two ſureties at the leaſt (and thoſe ſubſidie men) beſides the party himſelfe, and to bind them by recogniſance to the King, <hi>viz. domino Regi,</hi> and it muſt alwayes be for the keeping of the peace.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <note place="margin">Lamb. 104.</note>7. And yet by the opinion of Maſter <hi>Marrow</hi> (who was in the time of King <hi>H. 7.</hi>) a Iuſtice of peace might have taken this ſurety by a gage pawned to him only, but this is not the courſe at this day, but the ſecurity ought to be by recogniſance.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Alſo by his opinion a Iuſtice of peace might have taken this ſurety by an obligation made to himſelfe by the name of a Iuſtice of peace but this courſe is not now in uſe, and the ſafeſt way is by recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance, which is the uſuall way, for <hi>via trita</hi> is <hi>via tuta,</hi> and to ground his proceeding upon conceits.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Yet if a Iuſtice of peace had enjoyned a man upon paine of 20. l.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7522:138"/> to keepe the peace, this had beene nothing worth, but in this,<note place="margin">F.N.B. 81. d.</note> and the former two caſes, and the like, this one general ground or reaſon may be given for all, <hi>ſc.</hi> that a man cannot be bound to the King, but only by matter of record, and therefore ſuch ſuretie taken by gage or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, or ſuch enjoyning of the peace ſeemeth nothing worth to binde the party.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. A Iuſtice of peace may take a recogniſance (and thereby may binde the party) to keepe the peace for one yeare, or for a longer time (by his diſcretion) yea he may binde the party during his life, upon reaſonable cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. If the recogniſance be made to keepe the peace (generally) without any day or time limited, it ſhall be conſtrued to bee during the parties life.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. A Iuſtice of peace intending to take a recogniſance for the peace, and yet maketh no mention therein,<note place="margin">Dalton 155.</note> nor in the condition thereof, that it is for the preſervation of the peace, it ſeemeth to bee voide, as being taken <hi>coram non judice,</hi> for a Iuſtice of Peace hath no authoritie to take a recogniſance generally, but for matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his office ſpecially.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. If the Recogniſance be, that the party bound ſhall not beat nor maime A. yet it is not good,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> becauſe it ought to bee for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the peace, generally, and the peace may bee broken by bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the houſe of A. or the like.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. If the Recogniſance doe not limit any time of apparance, but be generally to keepe the peace, yet it is good, for the time of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is referred to the diſcretion of the Iuſtice, and the chiefe ſcope is, the keeping of the peace by Maſter <hi>Marrow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. Alſo, by his opinion, if the Recogniſance doe limit a time of apparance, but therein is no perſon named, before whom the party ſo found ſhall appeare, then may he appeare where he will, before that Iuſtice of peace which tooke the recogniſance, <hi>ibidem.</hi> but in that caſe I thinke the Condition is voide by reaſon of the incertainty.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. But in the two laſt caſes, if a recogniſance ſhould be taken in ſuch maner at this day, I ſhould thinke it ſafe for the party to appeare at the next Seſſions for the peace, and there to record his apparance, but to avoide theſe doubts, let the Iuſtice of peace expreſſe that the party ſhall appeare before his Majeſties Iuſtices of peace at the next generall Seſſions of the peace to be holden in that County, or at the next generall Aſſiſe and gaole delivery before his Majeſties Iuſtices of gaole delivery in that County, and in ſo doing theſe ſcruples are avoyded.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. If the Recogniſance be to appeare at any other Seſſions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (and not at the next Seſſions) yet the Recogniſance is good,<note place="margin">Crom. 141. P. Iuſt. 106.</note> and yet by the ſtatute of <hi>3. H. 7. cap. 1.</hi> It is enacted that every Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance taken for the peace, by the Iuſtice of peace <hi>ex officio</hi> ſhall bee certified (<hi>ſc.</hi> ſent or brought in) at the next Seſſions of the peace,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7522:139"/> and there delivered to the <hi>Custos Rotulorum,</hi> or elſe the Iuſtice of peace is fineable, but it doth not therefore follow that every Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance taken for the peace ought to be to appeare at the next Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that it ought to be brought in, and then the party may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the time expreſſed in the Recogniſance and not before.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. If the Recogniſance be in Twenty pounds to be levied of his lands only, or of his goods only, yet it is good, and theſe words (only may ſeeme voide) for the acknowledgement of the Recogniſance (before a competent Iudge) both maketh it a debt,<note place="margin">Dalton 1 55.</note> and implieth the ordinary meanes of Law to come to it.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. If the Recogniſance be to keep the peace towards the King, and all his people, but not towards any perſon certaine, yet it is good.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. So if the Recogniſance be to keepe the peace towards A. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">F.N.B. 80. g. Cromp. 141.</note> it is good, or to keepe the peace towards A. and his ſervants, without being bound toward the King, and all his Subjects, it is good enough.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. But the beſt forme is to bind the party to keepe the peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King and all his people, for firſt the words of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion are to finde ſuretie, <hi>erga nos &amp; populum noſtrum,</hi> and againe, the common uſage is ſo, and beſides it may prove dangerous to the party who hath cauſe to crave this ſurety of the peace, for the other party who ſhall give juſt cauſe to crave this ſurety againſt him (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not be bound to the peace towards him that prayeth it) he will perhaps pray to bind himſelfe to the peace to A. who is his Companion, and then if the Iuſtice of peace ſhall ſo bind him, then may he and A. goe to another Iuſtice of peace (and that peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture within one weeke) and there A. may releaſe him of the peace, and ſo the party that firſt prayed the peace, truſting that hee is ſtill bound, may be after beaten, maimed, or ſlaine by him or by his procurement.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. So then though the Recogniſance being taken in any maner or ſort aforeſaid may prove ſufficient to bind the party to the King, yet peradventure it will not excuſe the Iuſtice of peace from blame, and therefore it is ſafeſt for the Iuſtice of peace to follow the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved forme.</p>

                     <p n="24">24. The Recogniſance for the peace being thus taken, if it were by a writ of <hi>ſupplicavit,</hi> the Iuſtice ought to returne the writ, and to certifie, under his Seale, his doing therein into the Court from whence the <hi>ſupplicavit</hi> proceeded, and he may alſo ſend ſuch Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance, ſo taken by him, with this certificate, or elſe he may keepe the Recogniſance in his hands ſtill, untill he ſhall receive a <hi>Certiorari</hi> out of the Chancerie directed to him for removing of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſance.</p>

                        <note place="margin">3. H. 7. ca. 1. P.

                        <p n="1">1. Firſt in theſe indictments of forceible Entry, and Riots, (as alſo in all other endictments of felony or treſpaſſe) it is good to ſay <hi>contra pacem,</hi> or other words to that effect.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Alſo theſe words, <hi>vi et armis, viz. gladijs, &amp;c.</hi> are of neceſſity to be uſed in Ireland, eſpecially if the circumſtances of the fact doe require them, for theſe circumſtances doe either aggravate or diminiſh the offence, <hi>Stamf. fo. 94.</hi> becauſe the ſtatute of <hi>37.

Furthermore, that they hold not a Court of common pleas by admitting proofe of witneſſes againſt the King as knowing that they are not to try an iſſue, but to offer an Information, the truth or falſity whereof ſhall be afterward tryed by another Iury, upon which triall the party indicted ſhall be heard to ſpeake for himſelfe.<note place="margin">To keepe councell.</note> Finally, that they diſcover not their owne doings, for it is uſually a part of their oath, that they ſhall keepe the Kings Councell and their fellowes, and we read in <hi>Fitz. tit.

                     <p n="1">1. IT was the ancient manner, that twiſe in the yeare at the Sheriffes Turne (which was ſometime a Court of great authority and called Shiremoote) the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, and the Alderman (or Earle) of the ſhire ſhould be preſent the one to informe the people in the Lawes of God, and the other to inſtruct them in the Lawes of the land, as appeareth by Maſter <hi>Lambert li. 4. pag. 404.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lamb. li. 4. pag. 404.</note>

                     <p n="2">2. And it were to be wiſhed, that as there is commonly at every Aſſize a Sermon utred by ſome learned man, ſo alſo the like might be at each generall Seſſions of the peace: for ſeeing that the Lawes of men muſt be obeyed for God, it doth of neceſſity enſue, that he which will ſeeke to have man obeyed rightly, muſt firſt cauſe God to be preached truely.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Iuſtice of peace (ſaith maſter <hi>Fitz.</hi>) for their parts be bound to informe the people and (no doubt) the charge is given, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to inſtruct the ignorant leaſt they offend unawares, as to enquire of thoſe that have already fallen into danger by offence, and thereof it is, that many ſtatutes doe expreſſely command, that they ſhalbe openly read (or declared) at the Seſſions as you ſhall ſee, in place fit for it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But the manner of giving the charge, and receiving the verdict at this day differeth from that which the Iuſtices in Eyre<note place="margin">The ancient order of giving the charge in Eyre.</note> were wont to uſe, for you may ſee in <hi>Bract. fol. 116.</hi> that firſt one of the Iuſtices did open before the whole Aſſembly the benefits of the ſervice in hand, the commodities of keeping the peace, and the evils of the contrary, and that then the Articles of the charge were read by one and one to the Iurors, who receiving the ſame at the hands of the Iuſtices, did alſo make anſwere (in the yeelding up of their verdict) to each article ſeverally, and by it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Which cuſtome as it had many profits, ſo it is worthy in mine opinion to be recontinued and brought in uſe againe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Neither ought, the multitude of Articles (now inquireable) to diſcourage any man in this behalfe, for if thoſe lawes which be moſt ſerviceable either for the preſent time, or for the place, or other juſt reſpect, were only touched or run over, by way of ſhort Articles, then would there be the more time afforded for ſpeech that might be well ſpent, aſwell in diſcourſe of exhortation or dehortation, as in the larger handling of ſuch other ſtat. whereof there is greater uſe

                     <head>Of the indictments and preſentments given by the Iurors, and of the matter and forme, and receiving and rejecting of them. <hi>CHAP. 8.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. THe preparation to this Enquiry thus made, let us goe neare and looke alſo into the performance of the ſame,<note place="margin">Lamb. li. 4. pag. 485.</note> the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or knowledge which the Iuſtices of the peace doe take by the travell of theſe enquirors, is by their report put in writing and commonly called an indictment, or preſentment betweene the two, which words (howſoever they be confounded, or not rightly diſtinguiſhed, in common ſpeech) me thinketh that there doth eaſily appeare a true and certaine difference.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <note place="margin">Preſenment &amp; indictment. Ibid.</note>2. For I take a preſentment to be a meere denuntiation of the Iurors themſelves or of ſome other officer (as you ſhall hereafter heare) without any Information, and an endictment to be the verdict of the Iurors grounded upon the accuſation of a third perſon, ſo that a preſentment is but a declaration of the Iurors (or officers) without any bill offred before, and an endictment is their finding of a bill of accuſation to be true.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <note place="margin">Endictment.</note>3. An indictment ought therefore to be the verdict of Iurors that be charged to enquire of that offence which is preſented by them, for if A. be indicted of ſtealing the goods of B. and pleadeth thereto not guilty,<note place="margin">Lamb. li. 4. pag. 486.</note> and the Iury findeth that C. ſtole his goods, and that A. tooke them from him, but not feloniouſly, this verdict ſhall not ſtand for an indictment againſt C. becauſe that Iury had no charge to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire generally who did the felony, but to try ſpecially whether A. were hereof guilty or no. <hi>13. Ed. 4. 3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. But if A. be arraigned upon an Indictment of murder taken before the Coroner,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and is not found guilty; Now the Iury ought to finde who is guilty thereof, and if they ſay that C. killed the man, that verdict ſhall ſerve for a good endictment againſt C. becauſe the Iury had taken ſo much in charge, <hi>ibidem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. This alſo is generally true, that all bils, informations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments grounded upon penall ſtatutes (wherein the King only is to reape the forfeiture) ought to be commenced within three yeares next after the offence committed, and if the ſuite be given to any other perſon for him and the King, that ought alſo to commence for the King within three yeares, but if a common perſon ſhall informe for himſelfe and the King, then the Information, &amp;c. muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced within one yeare next after the offence done, otherwiſe it is meerely voyd, unleſſe longer or ſhorter time be limitted by that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſtatute upon which the Information, indictment, or preſentment is made and framed. <hi>28.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7522:194"/> ſaith Maſter <hi>Marrow</hi>) five principall things be moſt commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in preſentments before the Iuſtices of peace, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. The manner of the fact, and the nature of the offence, as the manner of the Treaſon, murder, felony, or Treſpaſſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The name and ſurname<note place="margin">The name and ſurname.</note> of the party indicted muſt be certainely expreſſed, and if the indictment be of an acceſſary in felony, the name of the principall muſt be ſet downe alſo, for if the indictment be <hi>quod</hi> A. <hi>mandavit euidam ignoto occidere</hi> B. <hi>quod fecit,</hi> this is vitious,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but in Treaſon, Treſpaſſe, or Murther, where all be principals, it may be <hi>quod procuravit perſonas ignotas</hi> to doe the Treaſon, Treſpaſſe, or Mayheime. <hi>Mar. &amp; Lambart li. 4. pag. 488.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. Beſides the name and ſurname of the party indicted, there ought alſo (by the ſtatute <hi>1. H. 5. ca. 5.</hi>) in every preſentment wherein proceſſe of utlary lyeth, to be added his eſtate, degree, or myſtery,<note place="margin">Lamb. li. 4. pag. 488.</note> and the County, Towne, Hamlet, or place, where he is, or was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and even ſo ought it to have beene at the common Law, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching names of dignity made by creation, as Duke, Marqueſſe, Earle, Viſcount, Archbiſhop, Biſhop, Knight, or Sergeant at the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every of theſe titles were accounted parcell of the name, but it was not ſo, for the names of Baron, Banneret and Eſquire which are names of dignity without creation, nor for Chancellor, Treaſurer, Chamberlaine, Sheriffe, Coroner, Eſcheator, Bailiffe, Deane, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, Deacon, prebendary, or parſon, which are names of dignity by reaſon of office onely, unleſſe the preſentment did charge them in reſpect of their offices, for then the name of office alſo as Bailiffe or Eſcheator ought to be uſed in the indictment. <hi>Marrow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. But now Baron, Knight, Eſquire, Gentleman, Alderman,<note place="margin">Degree or myſtery.</note> Widow, Single woman, Deane, Archdeacon, Parſon, Doctor, Clerk, Pariſh Clearke, are good additions of eſtate or degree (as I take it) within the meaning of this ſtatute of additions, but farmer, ſervant,<note place="margin">Lamb. li. 4. pag. 489.</note> Butler, Chamberlaine are not, becauſe they be common to Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Yeomen, and they be uncertaine, ſo Merchant, Grocer, Mercer, Tayler, Broker, Husbandman, Hoſtler, Labourer, Lighter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Waterman, Spinner, &amp;c. be good additions of myſteries, but Citizen is not, becauſe it is no myſtery, Art, or degree, neither is Extortioner, Maintainer, Vagabond, Hereticke, Dicer, Carder, or ſuch like, any good addition, becauſe they are every one evill and againſt the Law.</p>
                     <p n="9">9.

                        <note place="margin">Alias dictus.</note> which is often put in the addition, the uſe thereof is chiefely in writs grounded upon ſpecialties, and to make the writ and writing to agree, for (as touching endictments) if the party be not well named, both for his name of baptiſme, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, myſtery, or degree and place, at the firſt, then cannot the <hi>alias dictus</hi> make that good, which was not good before.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. And it appeareth <hi>(1. Ed. 4. 2.</hi> and <hi>2. Ed. 4. 16.)</hi> that the addition of the degree or myſtery muſt alwayes be ſuch as the party hath at the very time of the indictment, but the addition of the place may be of ſuch place where he was at any time before dwelling, ſo as the word <hi>nupèr</hi> be uſed with it.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Furthermore the indictment muſt containe the day, yeare and place,<note place="margin">The yeare, day and place.</note> in which the offence was committed. <hi>8.

IT falleth out not ſeldome, that when Iuſtices of the peace have taken an Endictment found before them, they cannot proceed to hearing and determining upon it, either becauſe their Commiſſion or ſome ſtatute whereupon it is grounded giveth unto them no further power, but only to enquire thereof: or elſe becauſe the Endictment is taken out of their hands by <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and convayed to Iuſtices of a higher authority, at the ſollicitation, and by the meanes of ſome parties grieved, to the end that they may either traverſe it above, or there avoyd it for inſufficiency of forme or matter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Albeit that in the removing of Pleas, betweene party and party, from inferiour to higher Courts, by Tolt, Pond, <hi>recordare, &amp;c.</hi> there was wont to be a probable cauſe alledged, for which the ſame were removed: yet in this caſe of the Crowne there needs no cauſe to be compriſed in the writ of <hi>Certiorari,</hi> becauſe they all be the Courts of the King, againſt whom the offence is committed, and it breedeth neither injury to the offendor, nor loſſe to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in what Court ſoever the offence be tryed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This <hi>Certiorari</hi> then, may command either the Record it ſelfe, or <hi>tenorem Recordi</hi> to be ſent up, and it ought to be obeyed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, for upon faile thereof, firſt an <hi>Alias,</hi> then a <hi>Pluries, (vel cauſam nobis ſignifices.)</hi> And laſtly an Attachment ſhall goe out againſt them that ſhould ſend it, as Maſter <hi>Fitz.</hi> noteth in his <hi>Nat.

                     <p n="1">1. THe obſtinacy of evill doers, that would ſhew no conſcience in acknowledging of their faults, and the corruption of Iurors that would preſent nothing that lay onely in their owne knowledges, have begotten and brought into our Law, this tryall by examination wherewith it was not before acquainted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And yet, this manner of tryall is not looſely permitted to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the peace, but in caſes only, where either the ſtatutes doe generally referre the tryall to their diſcretions, or elſe doe ſpecially authoriſe them to take the Examinations.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The examination then is ſometimes of the offendors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſometimes of witneſſes that can ſpeake to the matter, and ſometimes both of the parties and witneſſes: of every of which I will give you an authority, or twaine, and leave the reſt to your owne reading and examination.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Upon apparance (after proceſſe) againſt the offendors of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7522:202"/> ſtatutes of Liveries, the Iuſtices of peace may examine them, and thereupon convince them, ſo as if they were thereof convict by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. <hi>8. H. 6. ca. 4. &amp; 8. Ed. 4. ca. 2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. And becauſe it is often ſeene, that thoſe which have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an offence, will alſo increaſe their fault by denying the ſame, therefore ſome ſtatutes doe appoint that the Iuſt. of the P. ſhall take the examination of others,<note place="margin">Examination of others.</note> beſides the offendors themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Now whereas alſo ſome ſtatutes doe enable the Iuſtices of peace to heare and determine, by the generall word Examination, without ſhewing what perſons they ſhall examine: It ſeemeth to me that they may thereupon examine, aſwell the parties, as other witneſſes.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Thus farre of examinations, which whether they ought to be taken upon oath or no, where the oath is not namely given you may eaſily Iudge by that which I have already ſaid thereof in the firſt booke, and yet (for your further reſolution) I ſay now, that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations of witneſſes ought alwayes to be taken upon oath, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe the tryall hereof dependeth upon them.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. THe moſt ſolemne and ancient tryall of the fact againſt an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor that will not confeſſe it, is that which we ſee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the verdict of 12. good and lawfull men of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and it doth alſo beſt content and quiet the guilty man, for that it paſſeth by his owne Countrymen, Neighbours and Peeres, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient libertie of the land, whereunto every Free-borne man thinketh himſelfe inheritable.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And thereupon it is named in <hi>Mag. Chart. cap. 29. Legale judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um parium ſuorum,</hi> the lawfull judgement of a mans owne Peeres, or Equals, becauſe as the nobility, ſo alſo the Commonalty are to bee tryed, in treaſon, felony or miſpriſion of treaſon, not the one by the other, but each by men of their owne eſtate and calling: I meane by the word Nobilitie, as our owne law ſpeaketh (which calleth none Noble under the degree of a Baron) and not as men of forraine Countries doe uſe to ſpeake, with whom every man of gentle birth is accounted noble: For wee daily ſee, that both Gentlemen and Knights doe ſerve in the Parliament as members of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Howbeit in caſes of forceible Entrie, ryot, rout,<note place="margin">Lamb. li. 4. f. 539.</note> unlawfull aſſembly, or ſuch like, they of the Nobility ſhall be tryed by xij. men even as other inferiour ſubjects, <hi>3. &amp; 4.

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This Tryall happeneth before Iuſtices of the peace, ſometimes upon Traverſe, and ſometimes upon Arraignement.</p>

                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:7522:203"/>4. But yet, ſome things be common to them both: for, if the partie charged, will demurre in law upon the Evidence, the Iuſtices ought to record his demurrer: ſo if he will plead (in juſtification) any matter of Record that is before other Iuſtices, they ought to give him day to bring it in, <hi>Marr.</hi> So alſo, if the Iuſtices (thinking an Endictment to be void) have diſcharged the priſoner, paying his Fees, yet upon change of their opinion they may ſtay him againe, at any time before Iudgement. <hi>Fitzh. Endict. 27.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. But if he plead a pardon before them, in which certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be excepted, and the Kings Atturney is not preſent to joyne iſſue, that he which pleadeth it, is one of thoſe that be excepted, then they themſelves may ſupply the office of the Atturney, in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, <hi>8.

                     </p>

                        <note place="margin">The Kings advantage.</note>6. Whereupon alſo I gather this generall learning, that they ought not to ſuffer the King to be diſadvantaged, where it lyeth lawfully in their power to prevent it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And if an Endictment bee challenged, for ſuch cauſe as theſe Iuſt. will not allow, then may they ſeale a Bill of that exception for the party if he will write and require it according to the ſtatute. <hi>W. 2. ca. 30.</hi> as <hi>M. Marr.</hi> writeth.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Traverſe tooke the name of the French <hi>de Traverſes,</hi> which is none other then <hi>de tranſverſo</hi> in Latine, ſignifying on the other ſide: becauſe as the Endictment on the one ſide chargeth the partie, ſo he on the other ſide commeth in to diſcharge himſelfe: For whereas the arraignement proceedeth upon him that is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly brought in by Proceſſe, the Traverſe is (for the moſt part) freely tendred by the party himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. To Traverſe<note place="margin">Traverſe.</note> an Indictment then is to take iſſue upon the chiefe matter thereof, which is none other to ſay, then to make contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or to deny the point of the Indictment. As in a preſentment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt A. for a high way overflowne with water for default of ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ditch, which he and they (whoſe eſtate hee hath in certaine land there) have uſed to ſcowre or clenſe: A. may traverſe either the matter (<hi>viz.</hi> that there is no high-way there) or that the ditch is ſufficiently ſcowred: or otherwiſe he may traverſe the cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that he hath not that land, &amp;c. or that he and they (whoſe eſtate, &amp;c. have not uſed to ſcowre the ditch. <hi>5. H. 7. 3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. And this libertie of Traverſe is commonly reſtrayned to an Endictment of Treſpaſſes, contempts, Riots, &amp;c. and other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our offences within the Commiſſion or ſtatutes, authoriſing the Iuſtices of peace, and is not uſually extended to Treaſons, or felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as you ſhall hereafter ſee.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. And there is no doubt, but that as Iuſtices of the peace have power to award Proceſſe, the parties alſo have libertie to ſpeake for themſelves: and (having ſpoken) the Iuſtices may heare and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of their ſpeech, whether it touch them in Freehold or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:7522:203"/>12. For although it be holden (<hi>2. R. 3. 11. 19. H. 8.</hi> 11. &amp; <hi>Fitz. tit. Aſſ. 442.</hi> and in other bookes) that a man ſhall not be received to traverſe a preſentment, unleſſe it doe charge him in his Freehold: yet <hi>Huſſey</hi> and <hi>Fairefax</hi> ſaid (in <hi>5. H. 7. 4.</hi>) that a preſentment (not concerning freehold) which is found before Iuſtices of the peace may be traverſed: For if proceſſe be awarded, the partie may come in, and offer his Traverſe, or otherwiſe the proceſſe ſhould bee in vaine.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Hereunto agreeth <hi>Moubray (41. Ed. 3. 26.)</hi> ſaying further, that in a Leet ſuch a preſentment is not traverſable, becauſe out of a Leet no proceſſe can be awarded upon it. And this peradventure is the reaſon of the booke (<hi>8. Ed. 4. 5.</hi> and of <hi>M. Marrow.</hi>) where they ſay, that a preſentment of bloodſhed found in the Sheriffes Turne, and ſent (as it ought to be) to the Iuſtices of the peace, cannot be traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before them; as whereupon they can neither make proces, nor diſcharge the party by way of plea.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. So that this ſeemeth to be a generall learning that whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any proceſſe <hi>ad reſpondendum</hi> goeth out by force of ſuch an Indictment as is traverſable, there alſo the party may offer, and ought to have his Traverſe againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. But <hi>Marr.</hi> ſaith, that if a man be of an Enqueſt that indicted him of Treſpaſſe, or ſuch like (ſo that upon the matter, hee indicted himſelfe) this is ſo ſtrong, that hee ſhall never bee received to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. It is not my meaning to peſter this booke with Preſidents: But yet foraſmuch as in the record of one Traverſe, there is at once diſcovered the Stile of the Seſſions, the Indictment, the proceſſe to anſwer, the Traverſe it ſelfe, the verdict and Iudgement thereupon, the proceſſe of execution, the yeelding of the parties, and the aſſeſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Fynes, ſo that it alone may ſerve in ſtead of all: I truſt it ſhall not be troubleſome to inſert it, and it is as followeth:</p>

Lamb. li. 4. pag. 546.</note> doe not ſo much differ in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (or ſubſtance) of the Tryall it ſelfe, as in the order or uſage of the ſame. For as there is no Endictment traverſeable by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but that he may alſo be arraigned upon it: ſo likewiſe is there no Endictment whereupon the partie may bee arraigned, but that hee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7522:204"/> may alſo (if he will) tender his Traverſe unto it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The difference then ſtandeth in this,<note place="margin">Lamb. li. 4. pag. 547.</note> that commonly he (which is to be arraigned) commeth in by compulſion of bond, or proceſſe, and is touched with matter concerning life and death, or ſome ſuch haynous offence, and pleadeth generally not guilty to the Endictment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Commonly I ſay, becauſe although he come in freely,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and be indicted of ſome inferiour offence, yet he may be nevertheleſſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned: neither is he of neceſſity driven to plead not guilty (which runneth to the fact) but may (if the caſe will ſuffer) plead a juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or matter in Law, though it be in caſe of felony.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It ſeemeth to have borrowed the name out of the word Array,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> either of the panell, or Iury: becauſe he that is arraigned muſt be tryed by them being firſt called, arrayed, ſworne, and tryed, in order for that ſervice, or elſe of the array of the priſoners, that be peruſed and arrayed in order before they come to tryall.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If I ſhould here rip up, and proſecute at full (as the place offreth me occaſion) the whole learning that belongeth the arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tryall of Felons, aſwell for the taking of Challenge, and pleading of juſtification, matter in Law, pardon, another time acquite, and another time attaint: as alſo for the having of Sanctuary, and ſaving by Clergy; I ſhould but <hi>actum agere,</hi> and yet not doe it halfe ſo well as you may finde it in Maſter <hi>Stamford,</hi> beſides the which I ſhould endeavor to teach them, of whom I my ſelfe may better learne, ſeeing that for the moſt part the uſe of theſe matters is either reſerved till the comming of the grave Iuſtices of Gaole delivery or elſe is performed by other men of Law that can informe themſelves ſufficiently therein. Yet conſidering that theſe things doe many times fall in uſe in the County of Dublin, and that it were unſeemely for Iuſtices of the peace to be altogether ignorant therein, I will ſhortly run over them, but firſt let me offer to your conſideration a point or twaine, whereof it peculiarly behoveth our Iuſtices to be advertiſed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The firſt thing is, that there be ſundry felonies,<note place="margin">Felonies not tryable before Iuſt. of the P.</note> and ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments of felonies alſo the which (as it ſeemeth to me) Iuſtices of the peace cannot here, or try at all, the ſecond is that in the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of thoſe very felonies wherewith they may deale, there be yet certaine conſiderations peculiar to the Iuſtices of the peace only, and not common to them with other Iudges.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Of that firſt is the felony for forgery,<note place="margin">28. El. ca. 4. in Ireland.</note> by the ſtatute made in the xxviij. yeare of the Raigne of the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth ca. 4.</hi> in Ireland after conviction for a former offence.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Neither doth the hearing and tryall of that felony of a ſervant (taking the goods of his Maſter after his death) belong (as I have ſaid) to the Iuſtices of peace in the Countrey:<note place="margin">Lamb. li. 4. pag. 548.</note> becauſe they cannot take notice of his default in the Kings Bench by which default it firſt beginneth to be felony. <hi>33. H. 6. ca. 1.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">33. H. 6. ca. 1.</note>

                     <p n="35">35.

                     <p n="36">36. The ſecond is, for the commodity of ſubjects as in caſe where divers men be robbed of their goods by a felon, there, though he be attainted at the ſuite of one, yet ought hee alſo to be attainted at the ſuit of the reſt, that each of them may thereby have reſtitution of his goods, whereof otherwiſe for want of ſuit he ſhould be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Stamf. 165.</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7522:207" rendition="simple:additions"/> to the law, and is made anſwerable to all other felonies that were committed by him before the time of that felonie, whereupon his attainder was grounded. <hi>6. H. 4. 68.</hi>

And if a man doe commit two ſundry felonies, and (being arraigned upon the one) ſtandeth mute at the barre, and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his judgement to be preſſed, yet may he be arraigned upon the other felony, notwithſtanding the former judgement: becauſe it is none attainder at all for his offence wherewith he was charged, but onely a puniſhment inflicted by the Law upon his contumacie and ſtubborne ſilence, <hi>Collect.

With this there was wont to be matched the plea, That the priſoner was another time convict<note place="margin">Another time convict.</note> of felonie, and delivered to the Ordinarie to make his purgation: which alſo was of equall force (with the former plea) to ſave him from new arraignement; But the law of our time hath worthily taken that plea from the offendor, and the offendor himſelfe from the power of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. For as the allowance of the booke proceeded from the pride of Churchmen: Even ſo were thoſe convicts ridiculouſly purged by them. For which cauſe the ſtatute of <hi>11. Iacobi ca. 3.</hi>

                     <p n="47">47. If the pardon doe agree with the Endictment, aſwell in the name, ſurname, and addition of the party, as alſo in the point of the offence that is to be pardoned, then is there nothing to be ſaid againſt it.

                     <p n="3">3. There be alſo two ſorts of high Treaſon namely Treaſons by the common Law, and Treaſons by ſeverall ſtatute Lawes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Iudgement in high Treaſon<note place="margin">Iudgement in Treaſon.</note> by the common Law is that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7522:209"/> the offender ſhall be taken from the barre, and returned to the priſon where he was before, his irons there to be taken off, and from thence to be drawne upon a hurdle to the place of execution, and there to be hanged untill he be halfe dead; then to be cut downe alive, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails to be taken out of his body and his privy members to be cut of, and burnt in the fire before his face, his head to be cut from his body, and his body to be devided into foure quarters to be diſpoſed of at the Kings pleaſure.

Where offences which at the common Law were not Treaſon are by any ſtatute Law enacted to be high Treaſon without any more ſaying, in ſuch caſes the Iudgement againſt the offendors ſhall be to be drawne and hanged, but where the ſtat. ſaith that the offence ſhall be Treaſon, as if it had beene done againſt the Kings perſon, or if the words be that the offendors ſhall ſuffer ſuch puniſhment as in caſes of high Treaſon, then the offendors ſhall have Iudgement to be hanged drawne and quarterd.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Upon theſe differences it will follow that for breaking of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the ſtat. <hi>de frangentibus priſonam</hi> made in <hi>Anno 1.

                     <p n="8">8. There be likewiſe two ſorts of Felonies, that is to ſay, Felonies for which the offendor ſhall ſuffer death, and felonies for which the offender ſhall not ſuffer death.</p>
                     <p n="9">9.

                     <p n="10">10. For petty Larceny which is the ſtealing of goods under the value of twelve pence privily, and not by way of burglary, or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, the Iudgement is either by whipping, or impriſonment, ſo often or ſo long time, as the Court in diſcretion ſhall thinke fit, and if the offender be a woman and the felony exceed twelve pence, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the value of 10. s. her Iudgement is to be burned in the hand,<note place="margin">10.

                     <p n="11">11. Miſpriſions are of three ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> of Treaſon, of Felony, and other great and exorbitant miſdemeanors.</p>
                     <p n="12">12.

Where the Conviction is for Treſpaſſes againſt the peace, Riots, and ſuch other contempts and offences againſt the common Law or againſt ſome ſtatutes, for the which no certaine Fyne is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, there the Iudgement is, that the party ſhall be taken to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the King for his fyne: And thereupon, a <hi>Capias pro fine,</hi> is to iſſue and (if the party cannot be found) other Iudiciall proceſſe goeth out till he be utlawed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But if the party be brought in, then is he a priſoner, and then are the Iuſtices of peace (by their diſcretion) to aſſeſſe the Fyne, and to commit him to priſon for the ſame, and thereof to make an eſtreate, and ſend it into the Exchequer, that the Sheriffe may be charged therewith upon his accompt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For in no caſe can they of themſelves levy any Fyne or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture due to the King, inſomuch as not they but the Sheriffe is accountant for all ſuch matters.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. AS I have already manifeſted, that Iuſtices of the peace have not ſufficient power (of themſelves) to heare and determine all cauſes, whereof they have in their Seſſions authority to enquire: So alſo there be ſundry things determinable before them there, which nevertheleſſe may (in ſome reſpects) be brought to a ſecond handling, either to the end to reverſe that which they have done, or that their doings may be an evidence and teſtimony in the tryall of cauſes before other Iudges.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And becauſe this cannot in any ſort be performed, without the preſence of thoſe former Records (or the tranſcripts thereof) which began with the Iuſtices of the peace, it is therefore requiſite that they doe make certificate of them unto thoſe other Courts, or officers that ſhall uſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. But in caſes where Iuſtices of the peace have power to receive Endictments, and no power to proceed any further upon them, as in caſes of Treaſon and ſome others which I have formerly declared, there they ought to ſend up and certifie the Endictments themſelves into the Kings Bench, and that of duty without any <hi>Certiorari</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the ſame, becauſe having none authority to heare and try the offences, the Records thereof ſhall be unprofitable before them:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7522:213"/> and therefore they can have no juſt cauſe to retaine them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And ſo if a man that is bound to keepe the peace and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the next Seſſions of the peace doe make default of apparance the Recogniſance it ſelfe (together with the Record of that default) muſt be eſtreated into the Exchequer, that execution upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſance may be had there. <hi>3.

And likewiſe if it be preſented before them, that the chattels of a man attainted of felony, be in the hands of another; For, in theſe and ſuch other caſes where they cannot of themſelves proceed, they ought to ſend the Records to ſuch as have authority to determine upon them, and otherwiſe they doe not diſcharge that duty, which the words <hi>Salvis, &amp;c. &amp; alijs ad nos indeſpectantibus,</hi> in the Commiſſion doe ſeeme to expect at their hands.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

                     <p n="7">7.

                     <p n="2">2. Every quarter Seſſions is a generall Seſſions of the peace, and is ſtyled <hi>generalis ſeſsio pacis,</hi> but other Seſſions which are held upon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7522:213"/> ſpeciall occaſions, although all the articles inquirable in the Seſſions of the peace be given in charge are not quarter-Seſſions nor to be ſtyled <hi>generalis ſeſsio pacis</hi> but only <hi>Seſsio pacis, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. This quarter-Seſſions is ſo called, becauſe it is holden quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, <hi>viz.</hi> foure times in the yeare, and the ſtat. of <hi>4. H. 7. cap. 12.</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth theſe foure quarter-Seſſions principall Seſſions, for that in them chiefely the whole power and authority of the Iuſtices of peace doth ſhine and ſhew it ſelfe more then in other Seſſions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe quarter-Seſſions have beene appointed by ſeverall ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to be holden quarterly and at ſpeciall times, and therefore it will not be amiſſe for our better inſtruction to peruſe ſuch ſtatutes as doe either in deed or in ſhew concerne this point.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſtat. of <hi>25. Ed. 3. cap. 8.</hi> ordaineth That the Iuſtices of peace make their Seſſions in all the Counties of England at the leaſt foure times in the yeare, <hi>viz.</hi> at the Feaſts of the Annunciation of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Saint <hi>Margaret,</hi> S. <hi>Michael,</hi> and S. <hi>Nicholas:</hi> and alſo at all times that ſhall be needfull according to the diſcretion of the ſame Iuſtices.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But this ordinance was altered as to the times by the Stat. of <hi>36. Ed. 3. cap. 12.</hi> which ordaineth, that in the Commiſſion of the peace ſhall be contained that the Iuſtices of peace ſhall hold their Seſſions foure times in the yeare, <hi>viz.</hi> one within the <hi>Vtas</hi> of the Epiphanie, the ſecond within the ſecond weeke of Lent, the third betweene the Feaſts of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and the fourth within eight dayes next after <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. But this is againe altered as to the times by the ſtat. of <hi>12.

For before this ſtatute, although foure Seſſions were to be held yearely, yet the ſame were not quarterly.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But after this <hi>in Anno ſecundo H. 5. cap. 4.</hi> there was another ſtat. made, whereby it is ordained that the Iuſtices of the peace in every Shire named of the <hi>Quorum</hi> be reſiant within the ſame Shire except Lords named in the Commiſſion of the peace, and alſo except the Iuſtices of the one Bench and of the other, the chiefe Baron of the Exchequer, Serjeants at Law, and the Kings Attourney for the time that the ſame Iuſtices, Chiefe Baron, Serjeants at the Law, and the Kings Attourney be attending and occupied in the Kings Courts, or otherwiſe in ſome other place occupied in the Kings ſervice, and alſo make their Seſſions foure times by the yeare, that is to ſay, in the firſt weeke after the Feaſt of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> the firſt weeke after the Epiphanie, the firſt weeke after Eaſter weeke, and in the firſt weeke after the Tranſlation of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> the Martyr, which is the third of Iuly, and more often, if need be.</p>

                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:7522:214"/>9. Now there are divers offences which by ſeverall ſtatutes are inquirable, and ſome other things are to be done by the Iuſtices of peace, for the well ordering of the Common-wealth only at the Quarter-Seſſions, becauſe the Statutes themſelves doe appoint the Quarter Seſſions for the enquiring and doing of the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Statutes which doe appropriate divers matters to the Quarter Seſſions, or to ſome one of them are theſe that follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. By the Stat. of <hi>1.

                     <p n="14">14. Alſo by the ſtatute of <hi>11. Caroli cap. 4.</hi> in Ireland, the Iuſtices of peace, or the more part of them, may at any Quarter-Seſſions give order for the erection of houſes of Correction, and for ſtockes of money and all other things neceſſary for the ſame, and for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement thereof, and ſuch houſes of Correction are to be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, conveyed or aſſured upon truſt to ſuch perſons as by the Iuſtices of peace, or the more part of them, in their Quarter Seſſions of the peace ſhall bee thought fit, and ſuch Iuſtices may at their Quarter Seſſions of the peace next after ſuch houſes ſhall bee built, and ſo from time to time appoint Governours or maſters thereof, and may make them ſuch allowance and maintainance as they ſhall thinke meet. And if the maſters of ſuch houſes doe not every Quarter Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions yeeld a true and lawfull accompt unto the Iuſtices of peace of all ſuch perſons as have beene committed to their cuſtodie, or if the ſaid perſons trouble the Countrie by going abroad, or eſcape from ſuch houſes of Correction, the moſt part of the ſaid Iuſtices in their Quarter Seſſions may Fine the ſaid Maſters and Governors as they ſhall thinke fit.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. In like manner by the ſtatute of <hi>10. Car. cap. 18.</hi> in Ireland, the Iuſtices of peace in their open Seſſions have power to enquire, heare and determine the defaults of Vnder-Sheriffes, Sheriffes, Clerkes, or the Clerkes of Under-ſheriffes, and the defaults of bailiffes of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes for not duely executing their office according to the ſaid ſtat.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. So likewiſe by the ſtat. made in <hi>Anno 10. Car. cap. 26.</hi> in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Iuſtices of peace in the Quarter Seſſions with the aſſent of the Grand Iury have power and authority to taxe and ſet every inhabitant in any ſuch County, Baronie, Citty, Burrough, Towne
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7522:214"/> or Pariſh within the limits of their Commiſſions to ſuch reaſonable aide and ſumme of money as they ſhall thinke, by their diſcretions, convenient and ſufficient for the new building, repairing, reedifying and amendment of any Bridges, Cauſeyes, and Toghers, and after ſuch taxations made, the ſaid Iuſtices of peace ſhall cauſe the names and ſummes of every particular perſon ſo by them taxed to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a Roll indented, and ſhall alſo have power and authoritie to make two Collectors of every Baronie, Cittie, Burrough, Towne or Pariſh for Collection of all ſuch ſummes of money by them ſet and taxed, which Collectors receiving the one part of the ſaid Roll indented under the Seales of the ſaid Iuſtices ſhall have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authoritie to collect and receive all the particular ſummes of money therein contained, and to diſtraine every ſuch inhabitant as ſhall be taxed and ſhall refuſe paiment thereof, in his lands, goods and chattels, and to ſell ſuch diſtreſſe, and of the ſale thereof retaine and perceive all the money taxed, and the reſidue (if the diſtreſſe be better) deliver to the owner thereof. And likewiſe the ſaid Iuſtices of the peace have power and authoritie to name and appoint two Surveyors which ſhall ſee every ſuch Bridge, Cauſey, and Togher builded, repaired and amended from time to time as often as need ſhall require, to whoſe hands the ſaid Collectors ſhall pay the ſaid ſummes of money taxed, and by them received, and that the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Surveyors and every of them, and their executors and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators, and the executors and adminiſtrators of them, and every of them from time to time ſhall at the publike Seſſions of the peace make a true declaration and accompt to the Iuſtices of peace of the Shire, Citty, or Towne corporate wherein they ſhall be appointed Collectors or Surveyors of the receipts, payments and expences of the ſaid ſummes of money, and if they or any of them refuſe that to doe, that then the Iuſtices of peace from time to time by their diſcretions ſhall have power and authority to make proceſſe againſt the ſaid Collectors and Surveyors and every of them, their executors and adminiſtrators, and the executors and adminiſtrators of every of them by Attachments under their ſeales returneable at the generall Seſſions of the peace, and if they appeare then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to accompt as is aforeſaid, or elſe if they, or any of them refuſe that to doe, then to commit ſuch of them as ſhall refuſe to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward, there to remaine without baile or mainpriſe till the ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and accompt be truely made, and the ſaid Iuſtices have full power and authoritie to allow ſuch reaſonable coſts and charges to the ſaid Surveyors and Collectors, as by their diſcretion ſhall bee thought fit and convenient.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. And likewiſe by another ſtatute made <hi>in Anno 10. Carol. ca. 15.</hi> in Ireland, the Iuſtices of peace have power in their Quarter Seſſions to enquire, heare and determine all and every offence and offences of plowing, harrowing, drawing and working with Horſes, Mares,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7522:215"/> Gueldings, Garrans, and Colts by the Tayle; And alſo of pulling the wooll from living ſheepe in ſtead of clipping or ſhearing of them, and to puniſh the offendors by Fyne and Impriſonment.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. So likewiſe by the ſtatute of <hi>33. H. 8. ca. 9.</hi> in Ireland, the wages of Artificers and Labourers are to be rated twice in the yeare: <hi>viz.</hi> at the Quarter Seſſions next after Eaſter for that halfe yeare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and at the quarter Seſſions next after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> for the other halfe yeare, and the wages of ſervants which are to ſerve by the yeare to be rated in the Quarter Seſſions next after Eaſter. And in like manner by the ſtatute of <hi>13. R. 2. cap. 8.</hi> the Iuſtices of peace in any generall Seſſions are to ſet rates upon victuals and to puniſh the victuallers which breake thoſe Rates.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. But here <hi>M. Lambard</hi> in his fourth booke, <hi>cap. 19.</hi> of the Quarter Seſſions would make us to beleeve that if the quarter ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or generall ſeſſions of the peace be not holden at the preciſe times appointed by the ſaid ſtatute of <hi>2. H. 5. cap. 4.</hi> but that the ſame be held at any other time, the Iuſtices of peace have no power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of, heare, determine, or otherwiſe to intermedle with any of the matters aforeſaid, which are appropriated to the quarter Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for ſaith he ſuch Seſſions as are not held at the times preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the ſaid ſtatute of <hi>2. H. 5.</hi> are no Quarter Seſſions, and then all that is done before the Iuſtices of peace concerning the matters aforeſaid in any ſeſſions holden at any other time is <hi>coram non judice,</hi> and without warrant, but herein I am not of <hi>M. Lambards</hi> opinion, for that the ſeſſions named in ſome ſtatutes, the principall ſeſſions, in others the open Seſſions, and in others the generall or quarter ſeſſions of the peace are all one and the ſame, and are all ſtyled by one and the ſame ſtyle, that is, <hi>generalis ſeſsio pacis,</hi> and there is not any Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtyled by the name of Quarter Seſſions, although in common parlance we call them ſo, becauſe they are held quarterly. So as thoſe ſtatutes which referre any thing to the principall, the publick, open or quarter ſeſſions are all to be underſtood of that generall Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which is held quarterly, and all thoſe things may bee there handled, although the ſame be not held at the preciſe times preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the ſtatute of <hi>2. H. 5.</hi> as <hi>M. Lambard</hi> would have it to bee, for the authority whereby the generall ſeſſions of the peace are held is not the ſtatute of <hi>2. H. 5.</hi> nor any other ſtatute, but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion under the great ſeale, whereby the Iuſtices of the peace are authoriſed to hold their ſeſſions at ſuch times and places as they or any two or more of them, ſo as one be of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> ſhall thinke fit to appoint.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Alſo the ſtatute of <hi>2. H. 5. cap. 4.</hi> hath not any negative words, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that the ſeſſions ſhould not bee holden at any other times then thoſe which are mentioned in the ſame ſtatute.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. But if the ſtatute of <hi>2. H. 5.</hi> had been in the negative, or elſe if the Commiſſion had been ſpecially grounded upon that ſtatute
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7522:215"/> as formerly from <hi>36. E. 3.</hi> untill <hi>12. R. 2.</hi> it was grounded upon the ſtatute of <hi>36. E. 3. ca. 12.</hi> wherein expreſſe mention was made of the ſpeciall times wherein the Seſſions of the peace ſhould be holden, I ſhould have beene of <hi>M. Lambards</hi> opinion.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. So as upon conſideration of all the ſtatutes and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, I am of opinion clearely that the generall Seſſions of the peace held quarterly, although at other times then are mentioned in the ſaid ſtatute of <hi>2. H. 5.</hi> are holden by good warrant and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and are both generall, principall, open and Quarter ſeſſions within the meaning of all the ſaid ſtatutes, and maketh not any nullity of the Acts done therein, neither are the Iuſtices puniſhable for not obſerving the time appointed by the ſaid ſtatute of <hi>2. H. 5.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Commiſſion doth diſpence with the ſtatute in that point, yet notwithſtanding I could wiſh that the Iuſtices of peace by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their oath would be carefull to hold their Quarter Seſſions at thoſe appointed times.</p>

                     <head>Of the Rewards and puniſhments due to the Iuſtices of Peace in reſpect of their Seſsions. <hi>CHAP. 22.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. VVHileſt it was at the libertie of the Iuſtices of peace to hold their quarter Seſſions as ſhort time as they would, the law did not allow them any wages for their paines: But when the ſtatute <hi>(13. R. 2. ca. 10.)</hi> had bound them (under paine of puniſhment) to continue their Seſsions three daies together (if the affaires of their office did ſo require) the ſame ſtatute thought it meete alſo,<note place="margin">The wages of the Iuſt. of the P. at the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seſſion.</note> to allow to every of them iiij.s. by the day, for the time of their Seſſions, to be paid by the hands of the Sheriffe out of the Fynes and amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments riſing of the ſame Seſſions: and that the Lords of Franchiſes ſhould bee contributories to thoſe wages, after the proportion of their parts of the ſaid Fines and Amerciaments.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But becauſe it was very dilatory for the Iuſtices of peace to take thoſe wages at the hands of the Sheriffe (as I have already tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) upon the Eſtreat ſent out of the Exchequer: And for that alſo it grew in queſtion, whether ſuch Lords as were named in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the peace ſhould be partakers of the ſame wages: the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>(14. R. 2. ca. 11.)</hi> did plainely provide, that the wages of theſe Iuſtices ſhould be levyed and paid by the Sheriffe upon eſtreates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented betweene the Sheriffe and them: And that no Duke, Earle, Baron or Baronet (albeit they were Iuſtices of the peace, and did hold their Seſſions with other eight Iuſtices) ſhould take any wages for their office in their behalfe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And hereof alſo <hi>M. Mar.</hi> collecteth that how many ſoever
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7522:216"/> Commiſſioners of the peace there ſhall be aſſembled at theſe Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yet only eight of them ſhall receive the wages: becauſe (ſaith he) that at ſuch time as theſe wages were firſt appointed, the Law did take knowledge and make allowance only of eight Iuſtices and no more. And he alſo maketh it doubtfull, whether it bee not in the power of the Barons of the Exchequer, to appoint which eight, when moe be aſſembled at the Seſſions, ſhall have the wages paid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For the firſt point, it would bee ſomewhat hard (indeed) to ſtraine that ſtatute ſo farre, as to give wages thereby to ſo many Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as be now at theſe dayes in every Shire, and would be preſent at the Seſſions: and concerning the latter point, it ſeemeth by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Statute it ſelfe, that the ſheriffe ſhall firſt pay the wages, and then the Barons ſhall make the allowance according to the Indenture: So that I ſee no libertie of ſuch nomination left unto the Barons.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I confeſſe that it might breed both offence againſt the Sheriffe, and a jealouſie among the Iuſtices themſelves, to have one of them preferred before another in this payment: and therefore I thinke it wiſely done (as it is ſomewhere uſed) to beſtow the whole allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the defraying of their Common Diet.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If the Fynes and Amerciaments of the ſame ſeſſions (ſaith <hi>M. Marr.</hi>) will not fully amount to the ſumme of the wages then due to the Iuſtices, yet ſhall the wages be ratably payed out of them ſo farre as they will extend.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Hitherto of reward, henceforth of puniſhment.<note place="margin">Puniſhment at the Common Law.</note> It ſeemeth by the opinion of ſome Iuſtices <hi>(2. R. 3. 10.)</hi> that if a Iuſtice of the peace doe any thing of Record ignorantly, and for want of knowledge, that he ſhall not be puniſhed for it.<note place="margin">Lamb. li. 4. pag. 630.</note> And this opinion of theirs is not new in this realme, although it bee otherwiſe truly ſaid, <hi>Imperitia quoque culpae adnumeratur:</hi> for you may read in the old lawes of King <hi>Edgar (cap. 2.)</hi> and of King <hi>Canut. (cap. 14.)</hi> that if a Iudge had erred in his office, hee might then have excuſed himſelfe by oath; That he did it not of evill minde, and that he knew not how to doe better: which I ſpeake not to comfort men in careleſſe ignorance, but to ſhew you that men may erre and (erring by infirmitie) they are not altogether unworthy of pardon: and withall to let the Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of peace ſee, that it may be a fault to erre by ignorance, and that therefore they ought to ſtay (where they meet with <hi>non liquet</hi>) as their owne Commiſſion doth direct them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Now on the other ſide, if a Iuſtice of the peace will craftily embezell an Endictment or wilfully raze any part thereof, or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly enrole (or file) that for an Endictment which was never found by the Iurie. Then by the Reſolution of all the Iuſtices aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled before the King in the Starrechamber, <hi>2. R. 3.</hi> a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may goe out to enquire (by the oathes of twelve men) of ſuch his miſdemeanour, and if he bee convicted thereof, he deſerveth to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7522:217" rendition="simple:additions"/> looſe his office, and to make Fyne to the King according to the quantitie of his miſpriſion and offence, <hi>Ibidem fol. 10.</hi> And even ſo may he be puniſhed (as this booke leadeth mee to thinke) if he alter an Endictment of Treſpaſſe, into an Endictment of Felonie, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the opinion <hi>(27. lib. Aſſ. pl. 18.)</hi> be found againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. A Iuſtice of the peace may alſo be indicted of the unlawfull taking of money for doing his office, or of ſuch other falſitie, <hi>Fitzh. Na. b. 243.</hi> And if he cauſe a man to bee endicted at the Seſſions by former conſpiracy, or indirect practiſe, hee is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for it, as a private man. <hi>21. E. 4. 67.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. But if (in the handling of a cauſe at the open Seſſions) it happeneth him to ſpeake againſt an offendour ſomewhat exceſſively, yet he ſhall not bee puniſhed for it. <hi>Iuris enim executio non habet injuriam:</hi> Nevertheleſſe, Iudges ought not to abuſe their tongues by intemperance, but they muſt rather take great heed (as <hi>Cic. pro Font.</hi> ſaid) <hi>Quibus verbis utantur, nè quid nimis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratè poſitam, nè quid ab aliqua cupiditate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſum verbum eſſe videatur.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Concerning Treaſons, it is to be obſerved that at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law before the tenth yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, there were two ſorts of Treaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> high Treaſon and pettie Treaſon: but now by the ſtatute of <hi>10.
